# Project Overview

## Business Problems to Solve
Generic forecasting methods often fail to account for the unique market behaviors of different products, leading to costly inventory imbalances.
This tool solves that by applying appropriate statistical models using Excel—such as regression and seasonality indices to align procurement precisely with specific demand patterns.

# Methodology & Models

This project identifies four primary demand behaviors and implements a targeted statistical methodology for each:

**1. Stable Demand (Normal Distribution)**
- Use Case: Products with consistent sales and minimal fluctuations.
- Logic: Uses the Arithmetic Mean of historical data.

**2. Seasonal Demand**
- Use Case: Products that see predictable spikes (e.g., icemakers in summer).
- Logic: Calculates Seasonality Indices for each period (quarter) and applies them to the average baseline.

**3. Trend-Based Demand**
- Use Case: Products in a growth or decline phase.
- Logic: Uses Linear Regression Analysis ($y = mx + b$) to project future values based on the line of best fit.
- Key Metric: R-Squared is used to validate the strength of the trend.

**4. Complex Demand (Trend + Seasonality)**
- Use Case: Products growing in popularity that also have seasonal peaks.
- Logic: A hybrid approach. First, a linear regression establishes the "De-seasonalized" trend line; then, seasonality indices are reapplied to the regression result.

# Forecast Example

This model forecasts demand for products exhibiting a strong upward trend ($R^2 = 0.89$) and cyclical seasonality. The model involves calculating seasonal indices by dividing raw sales by the annual average to isolate periodic fluctuations. A linear regression analysis is then performed to establish a deseasonalized trend line; the final forecast is generated by multiplying this regression-based baseline by the average seasonal indices.
